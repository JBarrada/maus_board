## MAUS Board
This project was developed as a means to create a very inexpensive F1Tenth car. It is a Raspberry Pi “hat” that connects various peripherals required for a functioning autonomous vehicle.

In its current state it has connections for:
- Serial LiDAR device (FHL-LD19)
- I2C IMU (MPU6050)
- Neopixel RGB LEDs (two LEDs onboard)
- Standard servo and ESC connectors

In addition to that, various 5V and 3.3V power connections, spare I2C pads, an external RGB strip connection, and test points for any unused ESP32 pins.
